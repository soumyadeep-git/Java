                                                             Constructors 

Constructors are methods to create an object
They are of three types:

1st => Non parameterized constructor

Student() {

}

2nd => Parameterized contructor

Student(String name, int age) {

}

3rd => Copy parametrized (they are used copy the objects of one to another)

Student(Student one) {

}

As constructors there happens to to methods to destroy object i.e, DESTRUCTORS 

But, in java there is no need of them beacuse the garbage collector here automatically deletes the unused objects, variables, methods which is being not used in the 
code.
